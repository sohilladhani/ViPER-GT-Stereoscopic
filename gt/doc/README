This version of the software has the basic functionality to read, edit
and save data and configuration files.  Many of the scripts will need
to be modified to be site specific.

The default configuration/groundtruth path is <VIPERHOME>/GTF, the
default series path is <VIPERHOME>/DATA and the default src path is
<VIPERHOME>/src.

************************************************************************
Settting up a series:

	FOR 3.1 YOU DO NOT NEED TO HAVE A SERIES OF FILES, but of
            course you can still have one! (see RELEASE_NOTES)

	New Info File Format: (old format still works-assumes JPEGS)
		#VIPER_VERSION_3.0
		N     [0 = JPEGs, 1 = List of Files, 2 = MPEG file]
		Frame_Range [e.g 1 100,  iff N = 0]
		List of Filenames [iff N = 1]

	So you can choose from an ordered list of JPEGS, an unordered
list of files and a single MPEG file.  Of course you can always split
the file!

	To set up a series, a utility is provided in the bin directory
called mpeg2series which converts an mpeg file to series of jpg files
for VIPER it use.  

It requires:
	mpeg_play to convert to a series of ppm files and
	convert (part of imagemagick) to convert ppms to jpgs
	mpeg_encode to create movies

To use mpeg2series, copy an mpeg file to the location you want to
create the series.  A subdirectory will be created to hold the data,
so for example you can begin in the "data" direcotry.

	cd <VIPERHOME>/DATA
	cp <PATH_to_MPEG>/mympegfile.mpg .

Then move to the location of the mpeg file and run:
	mpeg2series mympegfile

Note there is not extension required (.mpg is assumed) A directory
"mympegfile" will be created, a copy of the mpeg file will be made in
that directory, and the conversion will occur.  The final results will
be a .info file and a series of .jpg files to be used by VIPER
	
************************************************************************
Running ViPER


ViPER is currently started from the commandline.  To run Viper, you
should create a series as a subdirectory of the data directory as
described above, and define a config file in the config directory.

ViPER is started from the <VIPERHOME> directory by typing

	source ViPER33.config
	viper3.3 <GTFFILE> <SERIESDIR>

Again, the default configuration path is <VIPERHOME>/GTF, the
default series path is <VIPERHOME>/data and the default src path is
<VIPERHOME>/src.

There is a file in the src directory called ViPER_GUI.properties which
defines some default values for the system. Users should understand
these parameters, but they should not have to be changed.

The RunIt script may need to be changed to suite local configurations

************************************************************************

Only limited functionality is present in the interface.  Changes can
be made and saved.  

Here are some notes:
 
* Files are saved to the config directory.

* Attributes can not be edited unless the valid (V) box is check.

* Attributes will not be propogated unless the propogate (P) box is checked.

* Attributes with a (*) in the name are static, so changing a single
  frame will change the attribute for the entire object.
 
* Data can not currently be loaded from the menus

* To edit a rectangle, you must click within 3 pixels of either a side 
	or corner to grab and move that side or corner.

* To move a rectangle, you can click and drag

* Only rectangles work right now...

************************************************************************
EXAMPLE

cd to <VIPERHOME>

#
# Note: lamp-partial.cfg is in the config directory and LAMP is in the 
#	data directory
#

	viper3.3 lamp.gtf LAMP 

Try editing the file, saving it and rereading it.

To Groundtruth LAMP from scratch, use

	viper3.2 lamp-empty.cfg LAMP 

************************************************************************

If you have downloaded ViPER-Samples, you can edit the properties file
in <VIPER_HOME>/CONFIG/ViPER-Samples to change the following lines:

#
#
#   Directory Paths
#

dataDir=/fs/orion4/LAMP/ViPER-Samples/DATA/JPEG/
configDir=/fs/orion4/LAMP/ViPER-Samples/GTF/
dumpDir=../dump

to reflect the location of your the samples then run

	source ViPER-Samples.config
	viper3.3 <GTFFILE> <SERIESDIR>

and the data will be extracted from the ViPER-Samples directory
