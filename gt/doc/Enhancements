Menus disappear over root image



		 ************************************
		       CLOSED BUGS/ENHANCEMENTS
		 ************************************

- Problem with writing the consecutive image files, and tieing rangle
	to propagate slider. Perhaps have a new pulldown for dump-all vs
	dump-range. 

- Keep selected objects highlight as frames change.


- Tie save to save in main menu
	pops up interface, writes #include "whatever.cfg" then all of the data


- Need propogate button on bottom of left panel which propogates over
a given range

- Propogate propogates both valid and invalid rows.  If the row is
invalid, it just propogates invalid.  If it is valid, it propogate valid + all of the information.

- Fix ABOUT: currently it does nothing
 

- When we select an object from the table that is not visable, can we
indicate that somehow raising the table? DONE



- Tie in "Show Records" (currently record view under utilities) which
essentially pops up the "saved data" in window PRIORITY

- Add in "Show Configuration (pops up config dump).  You already have
the text from the dump at the beginning, dump it to a window just like
before  PRIORITY

- Toggleing valid should draw/erase data for spatial attributes - BUT
DATA SHOULE STAY

- Add pop-up "File" table so we can edit file information - SHOULD WRITE DATA


- Add Dump Image and Dump Images.  Loops through all images and dumps ppms to a "DIRECTORY" created with a file dialog

- Do Something better with debug statements


- Make propogate more robust...  Ie Write out what is being propogated? or 
an error saying nothing propogated.

- Allow groups of shapes to be moved together.

- Tie in Load DATA

- Change title on ID to "OBJ ID"

- Problems with meta keys and string interaction - Make them all ctrl-keys



- Add Circles


- Restricting drawing of bboxes

- Fixing Static bug

- Solving menu draw bug

- Print content out as one big group

- Solving null pointer bug. (DONE BY FELIX!)
